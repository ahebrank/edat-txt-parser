# edat/edat2 txt parser

This is a package for reading in [E-Prime](http://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm) data files (well, the txt recovery files generated by E-Prime scripts during an experiment). It's for those needing to analyze large batches of edats, don't have access to PST's data utility E-DataAid, or don't have Windows. As far as I know, PST does not make the format of the binary .edat/.edat2 files publicly available, so this is all just guesswork.

Inspiration for this utility and credit for early versions of the code go to [canlab's MATLAB implementation](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore/blob/master/Misc_utilities/parse_edat_txt.m), developed in 2010 by Joe Wielgosz.

Use at your own risk! I have a limited number of test cases, most of which were produced by the same E-Prime programmer (me!).  Please use the issue tracker to report bugs or submit test cases.

## Getting Started

The easiest way is to use devtools' `install_github` function.

### One-time install

```
> install.packages('devtools')
> devtools::install_github('ahebrank/edatparser')
```

### Using the parser

```
library('edat-txt-parser')
e <- edat('Flanker-1001-1.txt')
dat <- as.data.frame(e)

dim(dat)
head(dat)
```
